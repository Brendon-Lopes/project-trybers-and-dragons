# Project Trybers and Dragons

A project made to practice OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in a game format, with classes and interfaces for Archetypes, Races, Battle, etc.

It uses many aspects of OOP, like abstract classes, static methods, getters and setters, inheritance, implementations and more.

The code and organization of folders and files follows the principles of SOLID.

## ðŸ›  Tools / skills

TypeScript, OOP, SOLID.

## Usage

- To clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Brendon-Lopes/project-trybers-and-dragons.git`

- `npm install` to install the dependencies.

- (In case you don't have node installed on your machine): There is a `docker-compose.yml` file (made available by Trybe). Just run `docker-compose up` to run node inside a docker container.

- `npm start` to run the src/index.ts file, that contains some pre-made instances of some classes, feel free to play around with the other classes and create your own world, interactions and battles :D

## Final Considerations

It was pretty fun playing around with OOP. It's very intuitive and very handy in many situations. I'll definitely continue using OOP and expanding my knowledge in this area.
